There is no release yet, please be patient.
But a BETA exists! Here are the current versions:

[4ever BETA 0.5.4](https://github.com/TheSemikon43/4ever/raw/main/downloads/beta/4ever-beta-054.rar) - First BETA release

4ever tool is mostly open-source and easy to use. The only file which is compiled is the main file called 4ever-tool.exe (originally 4ever-tool.cmd). There is an additional tool called BatToExe which is in the .exe format, but as it is not made by me (The_Semikon43#6969), I can only link the original creator's GitHub page (https://github.com/99fk).
